      <h3>Project description</h3>
      <p>This is a final project that me and my team made for a course called New Media Image.
        This short film is about a guy named Kevin, he has always been afraid of the dark.
        Although unsuccessful in his past attempts to face his fear, a power outage plunges
        him into darkness and forces him to confront his weakness.</p>
        <h3>Role</h3>
            <p>Camera operator, Editor</p>
        <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p>Group disagreement : </p>
            <p>Through out the whole processing, from the ideation at the beginning to the final product is finished, we have inifinte and uncertainty.
            Ideas about the storyline are differnt between each members, somtimes even we made it to an agreement, things such as resources and the environment
            do not allow us to do it. Then we need to change plan and come up with a new idea again. </p>
            <p>Group members drama : </p>
            <p>One of our member had a crush on another member, but then that member was already in a relationship, even she tries to reject him,
            he would still try to start a converssation with her out of our production time. Ever since then, she tried to avoid conversation
          and eye contact, becasue it is making her uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>Inadquate skills/resources for origonal idea : </p>
            <p>During the ideation for the storyline, we had very great ideas. However, to make it work it real life isn't easy. Some of the excellent scene that we were imagining
            could not work out, because none of our team member came from a filming background, we were all quite new in filming.</p>
            <p>Damaging gear : </p>
              <p>Almost to the end of our shooting progress, one of our member broke the others camera lens. There were drama going on between them ealier
              the time, this accident make the sitation bad again. Other than the fight between those members, we have to completely stop our process, since
            the shooting progress can not move any forward without a lens.</p>
        <h3>Solution</h3>
          <p>Majority vote for final decision or come up with better idea : </p>
          <p>We all have vary ideas in mind, when we came together, it is multiple different ideas and everyone thinks that they get the best in mind. We go through each one's idea, discuss the good
          and bad for each of them. At the end we used majority vote for final decision </p>
          <p> Pause the whole process and communicate with each other :</p>
          <p> The team can not move forward wihtout good communication, being louder than the other person does not mean that you are right, neither does beginning
            quiet and hiding your opinion. Since the drama really brings us troubles and it slows down the processing of filming. We finally get them to sit down and talk about their problems</p>
          <p> Keep refining story/scene until we have the ability to complete the task :</p>
          <p>When our cuurent idea does not work out for some certain reason, then think of another idea. It is harad to give up the idea that we already had, but more important is to finish the job,
          so we will need to refine our ideas to make it happenes</p>
            <p> Look for alternative gears :</p>
            <p> Luckly there are still some stock of lens at the school library, so we are able to rent an alternative from school, and keep moving forward on filming</p>
          <h3>Takeaway</h3>
            <p>During the real shooting process, things such as weather, actor gears etc., might be changed or somethins are out of our control.
              Due to the urgency of the deadline, we are required to finish the final dliverable before deadlin. We will need to observe the environment, hence use the resources in hand
              to create the best we can for the final deliverable. We do not get to pick our luck and things can never move in a way that you want it to, but that does not mean that
              we can just give up. We need to know our goal and archieve it as close as we can. Beside, I realize communication in a team work is extremely important, the key to make things run smoothly,
              we need to bring it up to everyone instead of hiding it. We also need to listen to others opinion becasue othera may have btter ideas than you. Open up your mind is the biggest
              thing I learn from this work, things become so easy when you are willing to open up yourself.
