  <h3>Project description</h3>
  <p>This is an individual project that I made for a course called Moving Images. For this project, visual effect is
  required and to learn new VFX skills is the goal of the project. This video ironically presents a mobile brand which
tries to up sell it's alternatives to boost up their sales</p>
    <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>Lighting director, Camera operator, Editor, Booking green room studio, renting gears</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Inadequate skills to create visual effect; Difficulty on post production due to different hair style
          from re-shooting</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>Look for tutorials and give it a try; Shoot from different angle to avoid showing the difference</p>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
        <p>During that one shooting process, record as many clips as possible to create backups. It helps
        remaining the consistency of the character outlook and placement of the camera </p>

    <h3>Project description</h3>
    <p>This is a final project that me and my team made for a course called New Media Image.
      This short film is about a guy named Kevin, he has always been afraid of the dark.
      Although unsuccessful in his past attempts to face his fear, a power outage plunges
      him into darkness and forces him to confront his weakness.</p>
      <h3>Role</h3>
          <p>Camera operator, editor</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
          <p>Group disagreement; Group members drama; Damaging gears, Inadquate skills/resources for origonal idea</p>
      <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>Majority vote for final decision or come up with better idea; Pause the whole process and communicate with each other,
        get back to work after discussion; Look for alternative gears; Keep refining story/scene until we have the ability to complete the task </p>
        <h3>Takeaway</h3>
          <p>During the real shooting process, things such as weather, actor gears etc., might changed or they could be different from ideation.
            Due to the urgency of the deadline, we can not delay nay work, We will need to observe the environment, hence use the resources in hand
            to create the best we can for the final deliverable.
