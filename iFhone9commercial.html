  <h3>Project description</h3>
  <p>This is an individual project that I made for a course called Moving Images. For this project, visual effect is
  required and to learn new VFX skills is the goal of the project. This video ironically presents a mobile brand which
tries to up sell it's alternatives to boost up their sales</p>
    <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>Lighting director, Camera operator, Editor, Booking green room studio, renting gears</p>
    <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Inadequate skills to create visual effect; Difficulty on post production due to different hair style
          from re-shooting</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>Look for tutorials and give it a try; Shoot from different angle to avoid showing the difference</p>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
        <p>During that one shooting process, record as many clips as possible to create backups. It helps
        remaining the consistency of the character outlook and placement of the camera </p>
