  <h3>Project description</h3>
  <p>This is an individual project that I made for a course called Moving Images. For this project, visual effect is
  required and to learn new VFX skills is the goal of the project. This video ironically presents a mobile brand which
tries to up sell it's alternatives to boost up their sales</p>
    <h3>Role</h3>
        <p>Lighting director, Camera operator, Editor, Booking green room studio, renting gears</p>
      <h3>Challenges</h3>
        <p>Inadequate skills to create visual effect : </p>
        <p>The main goal of this assignment is to show that we know some special effect. However, I have been doing mostly photography and filming,
        but not special effect. Therefore, I do not have enough skills and knowledge to finish the reqirement of this assigment </p>
          <p> Difficulty on post production due to re-shoot :</p>
          <p>After getting feedback from professor and teaching assistant, they have recommmended me to record some more content, to strengthen the content,
          and make the flow smoother. However, during the second time, the character show up with a different hair style. It will be obvious for the difference from
        both time</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>Look for tutorials and give it a try :</p>
        <p> There are a lot of tutorials on the internet, resoucees online are more than enough for me to handle this project.
        The only problem is that it is very time consuming to figrue out the proper tutorials for my project. Since the idea
      that I have requires multiple special effects, so I will need even more time to look for tutorials, watch those tutorials,
    and try to implement it to my video </p>
      <p> Shoot from different angle to avoid showing the difference :</p>
      <p>After getting feedback from professor and teaching assiant, there are some more content that I can add to the video. So I shot
      some more clips later. Since the character has a different hair style, if I shoot it from the same angle, the difference would be quite different.
    Therefore, I picked another angle to shoot my character, hoping to reduce the difference as much as possible </p>
      <h3>Takeaway</h3>
        <p>During that one shooting process, record as many clips as possible to create backups. It helps
        remaining the consistency of the character outlook and placement of the camera. Beside, I should care about the outlook of the character more,
      if I could I would have reminded him to make sure everything looks the same from the previous time. I only paid attention to clothing, but I forgot about hair.
    It shows that I am not considerin enough for the consistency. I understand that working on a video alone is surely a lot of work, but careless mistake leads to
  failure is not acceptable. I could have write down all the important notes to remind myself. </p>
